# Notes

- Functions do not have to be in seperater files (check ft_mem.c, ft_is.c, ft_to.c)
- All part 2 and bonus funcs have been protected.
- Most testers pass 100 (notably francinette (w/ and wo/ -s), unit-libft-test (not fran one), etc...)
- .PHONY in Makefile is not really necessary, especially for this project (no files with rule names)
